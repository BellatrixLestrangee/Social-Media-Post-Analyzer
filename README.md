# Social Media Post Analysis

The idea is to create a web application that takes a social media post as input (the post could consist of text, images and videos) and evaluates the post in parts as the following -


Analysis of tone of the text, tone categories could be like anger, fear, joy, sadness, analytical, confident, tentative etc.


Emotion detection and Sentiment analysis of Images and videos, the categories could be love, happiness, violence, fear, sadness etc.
