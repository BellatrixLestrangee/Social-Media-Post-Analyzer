# Social Media Post Analysis

### The idea is to create a web application that takes a social media post as input (the post could consist of text, images and videos) and evaluates the post in parts as the following -
* ### Analysis of tone of the text, tone categories could be like anger, fear, joy, sadness, analytical, confident, tentative etc.
* ### Emotion detection and Sentiment analysis of Images and videos, the categories could be love, happiness, violence, fear, sadness etc.

#### I can think of the following use cases for this service:

* Through the reviews that users post on either Twitter or other platform can be used by a company to know the emotions their customers express regarding their product. Companies can collect tweets that either contain their username or hashtags and run the tweets through the service to get this information.
* Admin can automate the task of post approval by running the post through the service and making sure that the post is free of some kind of obscene/violent pictures and videos.
* You might want to send an email to your boss but don't want to give a wrong impression by an angry and improper tone. So you need to just run the content of your email through the service to be sure about the tone you are giving off.

more could be thought of in the coming time...
